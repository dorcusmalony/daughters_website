**Challenges and Learning Experiences**

Throughout this project, I encountered several challenges:
**Time Constraints**:
I did not have enough time to learn Django well enough to implement all the functionalities.

**Learning Django**:
As a new tool for me, learning Django and its concepts was challenging and time-consuming.

**Server Issues**:
I faced issues running the server smoothly, which I am still working on resolving.
Despite these challenges, I am committed to continuing my learning journey and improving the platform to provide a valuable resource for young women.
